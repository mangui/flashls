## creating an HLS instance

first thing you need to do to integrate HLS playback into your application is to instanciate an HLS object, that will be used as entry point to interact with flashls.

see example below

```as3
	import org.mangui.hls.HLS;
    import flash.media.Video;

	// create instance
	var hls : HLS = new HLS();
	// setting stage
	hls.stage = this.stage;
	// creating video (or StageVideo)
	video = new Video(640,480);
    video.x = 0;
    video.y = 0;
    video.smoothing = true;
    video.attachNetStream(hls.stream);
```
you can also refer to [Basic] (src/org/mangui/basic/Player.as) or [Chromeless](src/org/mangui/chromeless/ChromelessPlayer.as) players source code to get inspiration and see how to deal with StageVideo for example.

## Loading a m3u8 manifest

loading is peformed asynchronously.
below API should be used

```as3
hls.load(url)
```
flashls will fire below upon completion of manifest loading:

```as3
HLSEvent.MANIFEST_PARSED
HLSEvent.MANIFEST_LOADED
```
see [events below](##Events)

## retrieving playlist type

```as3
	hls.type (VOD/LIVE)
```

## controlling playback

playback control should be performed through a [flash.net.NetStream](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/net/NetStream.html) instance, which can be retrieved using hls.stream getter


```as3
	hls.stream.play(null, -1);
	hls.stream.seek(50);
	hls.stream.pause();
	hls.stream.resume();
	...

```

## retrieving/monitoring player state

### playback state

there are 2 ways to retrieve playback state :

  - synchronously, using a getter
```as3
	hls.playbackState (IDLE/PLAYING/PAUSED/PLAYING_BUFFERING/PAUSED_BUFFERING)
```
  - asynchronously

by monitoring the below event, that will be triggered for every playback state change.
```as3
HLSEvent.PLAYBACK_STATE
```

### seek state

there are 2 ways to retrieve seek state :

  - synchronously, using a getter
```as3
	hls.seekState (IDLE/SEEKING/SEEKED)
```
  - asynchronously

by monitoring the below event, that will be triggered for every seek state change.
```as3
HLSEvent.SEEK_STATE
```

### monitoring playback position, buffer progress, live playlist sliding, watched time ...

#### hls.position
return current playback relative position( relative to live main playlist sliding), in seconds

#### hls.liveSlidingMain
Return the live main playlist sliding since previous out of buffer ```seek()```, in seconds 

#### hls.liveSlidingAltAudio
Return the live alternate audio playlist sliding since previous out of buffer ```seek()```,in seconds

#### hls.stream.bufferLength
Return the current buffer length, in seconds

#### hls.stream.backBufferLength
Return the current back buffer length, in seconds

#### hls.watched
Return the current watched time in seconds, since last call to ```hls.load(URL)```

#### hls.droppedFrames
Return the total number of dropped video frames, since last call to ```hls.load(URL)```

## Controlling Quality Switch

by default flashls handles quality switch automatically, using heuristics.
It is however also possible to manually control quality swith using below API:


#### hls.levels
return array of available quality levels

#### hls.firstLevel

get :  first level index (index of first level appearing in Manifest. it is usually defined as start level hint for player)

#### hls.startLevel

get/set :  start level index (level of first fragment that will be played back)

  - if not overrided by user : first level appearing in manifest will be used as start level.
  -  if -1 : automatic start level selection, playback will start from level matching download bandwidth (determined from download of first segment)

default value is firstLevel

#### hls.seekLevel
get : return quality level used to load first fragment after a seek operation

#### hls.currentLevel
get : return current playback quality level

set : trigger an immediate quality level switch to new quality level. this will pause the video if it was playing, flush the whole buffer, and fetch fragment matching with current position and requested quality level. then resume the video if needed once fetched fragment will have been buffered.
set to -1 for automatic level selection

#### hls.nextLevel
get : return next playback quality level (playback quality level for next buffered fragment). return -1 if next fragment not buffered yet

set : trigger a quality level switch for next fragment. this could eventually flush already buffered next fragment
set to -1 for automatic level selection

#### hls.loadLevel
get : return last loaded fragment quality level.

set : set quality level for next loaded fragment
set to -1 for automatic level selection


#### hls.autoLevel
getter : tell whether auto level selection is enabled or not

#### hls.autoLevelCapping
get/set : capping/max level value that could be used by automatic level selection algorithm

default value is -1 (no level capping)

#### ```hls.startLoad()```
start/restart playlist/fragment loading. this is only effective if MANIFEST_PARSED event has been triggered

##Events

flashls fires a bunch of events, that could be registered as highlighted below:

```as3
	hls.addEventListener(HLSEvent.MANIFEST_LOADED, _manifestLoadedHandler);


	private function _manifestLoadedHandler(event : HLSEvent) : void {
         var duration : Number = event.levels[_hls.startLevel].duration;
    };

```
full list of Events is described below :
